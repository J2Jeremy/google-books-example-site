A little project I came across during an interview assignment. Uses google books API, json, bulma.io css framework, jquery. 

Features: sorted titles, show/hide results, responsive, modal meta information.

To-do: Styling, postCSS, modular javascript. Refactor to use JS classes and objects rather than DOM objects.
